# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to assist Dana in providing a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings by enabling users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time on her UFP sighting website. Filters for city, state, country, and shape were added to the already existing date filter.

## Results

To use the filter function on the webpage follow the instructions below:

 - Scroll down to the bottom left of the page. 
 - You can filter by one or all criteria. 
 - Enter a date to see results by date, a city to see results by city, etc.
 - Once you enter a value in the field(s) hit "Enter" on your keyboard. 
 - You will see results to the right of the filter fields, if any are returned.
 - If no results are returned, then there were no matches for the criteria entered.  
 - To clear results and begin again you can: 
    - 1. Refresh your browser or
    - 2. Clear each field and tab over to or click anywhere else on the page

See below for examples of search results for each criteria:

## Summary

Potential Drawback:

 This website showcases a fun and interactive way for the user to review UFO sighting accounts by date, city, state, country, and shape. Although it allows for multiple search criteria at once, a drawback to this design in that the searchability would be more beneficial for a larger data set. This data is limited to January of 2010 and only the US and Canada. A user may find the search criteria too broad for a small data set, and may have some difficulty getting filters to yield the intended results. 

Additional recommendations:

 Including more data (possibly scraped from additional web pages) would yield more search results, and allow the filters to function with their full capability. Filtering data from only one month is very limited   

 Another way to develop the page for future users would be to clean up the data in the comments or potentially exclude some of it, allowing for a cleaner comment section. Dana could also add a filter for text within the comments, so the user could view all comments that include a specific word or number in order to view trends and where they originated
